I am a passionate Information Technology professional with a growing specialization in Cybersecurity. My journey began as a certified Oracle Expert and Oracle Certified Associate, where I gained experience in Linux applications and database management using SQL.

To further solidify my technical expertise, I pursued a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology with a focus on Business Intelligence. During my studies, I explored Cybersecurity, which became an integral part of my coursework and projects. I applied cybersecurity principles to fortify web applications and enhance their security. Some of these projects are included in this portfolio and are currently running.

Cybersecurity Skills & Certifications

I recently earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, where I gained hands-on experience in:
âœ… Linux administration
âœ… SQL & Python for security applications
âœ… Log analysis using Wireshark, SIEM, and Splunk

I have documented screenshots of hands-on cybersecurity tasks I completed during this certification, which are available in this portfolio.
